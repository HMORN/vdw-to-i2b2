=[HMORN Virtual Data Warehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMORN_Virtual_Data_Warehouse) to [i2b2](http://i2b2.org) ETL Scripts
In 2012(?) [Group Health Research Institute](http://grouphealthresearch.org) installed an instance of i2b2 for use by researchers.  Rather than populating it from our indigenous data sources (which are many and varied) we opted to use our VDW implementation, both because it was considerably easier to do so, and in the hope that other VDW-implementing sites would be able to use it as well.
